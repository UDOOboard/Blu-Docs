The UDOO BLU power is managed by a low-dropout or LDO regulator.

You can provide power to the UDOO BLU in two ways:

### Button-Cell CR2032

A **Button-Cell CR2032 3v Li-Mn** via the Battery Holder(BT2) in the bottom side of the board.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> The positive side (+) of the button cell need to be connected to the external side of the connector.

### External Power Supply

An external power supply **min 3V and up to 5.5V** via the EXT Battery connector(BT1) in the top side of the board.
