## Accelerometer/Magnetometer FXOS8700CQ - R1

**FXOS8700CQ** is a small, low-power, 3-axis, linear accelerometer and 3-axis, magnetometer combined into a single package. The device features an I2C with 14-bit accelerometer and 16-bit magnetometer ADC resolution along with smart-embedded functions.  
FXOS8700CQ has dynamically selectable acceleration full scale ranges of ±2g / ±4g /±8g and a fixed magnetic measurement range of ±1200μT. Output data rates (ODR) from 1.563 Hz to 800 Hz are selectable by the user for each sensor. Interleaved magnetic and acceleration data is available at ODR rates of up to 400 Hz.  
FXOS8700CQ is guaranteed to operate over the extended temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C.

* **I2C address: `0x1E`**

## Gyroscope FXAS2100CQ - R1

3-Axis Digital Angular Rate Gyroscope **FXAS21002C** is a small, low-power, yaw, pitch, and roll angular rate gyroscope with 16 bit ADC resolution. The full-scale range is adjustable from ±250°/s to ±2000°/s. It features I2C interface. FXAS21002C is capable of measuring angular rates up to ±2000°/s, with output data rates (ODR) from 12.5 to 800 Hz.
An integrated Low-Pass Filter (LPF) allows the host application to limit the digital signal bandwidth. The device may be configured to generate an interrupt when a user-programmable angular rate threshold is crossed on any one of the enabled axes. FXAS21002C is guaranteed to operate over the extended temperature range of –40 °C to +85 °C.

* **I2C address: `0x20`**
