Consulting the [BLE Firmware](!BLE_Firmware/BLE_Overview) section you can develop your BLE software to communicate with the UDOO BLU using the programming language you prefer.  
Usually every programming language provides standard BLE libraries to manage BLE communication with a BLE peripheral like UDOO BLU.

In this section you can find some useful high-level libraries to communicate with the UDOO BLU easily.

# Android Library - UDOOBluLib

**UDOOBluLib** is the Official Android library to communicate with the UDOO BLU.

You can find all the source code and info about the library in the [UDOOBluLib Github page](https://github.com/UDOOboard/UDOOBluLib-android).
