**UDOO BLU** comes with a preloaded official **Bluetooth LE v4.1 firmware**.

From the [Bluetooth Low Energy Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy) page:

> **Bluetooth low energy** (**Bluetooth LE**, **BLE**, marketed as **Bluetooth Smart**) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment industries.[3] Compared to Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range.

From the [Bluetooth Low Energy Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/how-it-works/low-energy) page:

> **Bluetooth low energy (LE)** is the power- version of Bluetooth that was built for the Internet of Things (IoT).
The power-efficiency of Bluetooth® with low energy functionality makes it perfect for devices that run for long periods on power sources, such as coin cell batteries or energy-harvesting devices. Native support for Bluetooth technology on every major operating system enables development for a broad range of connected devices, from home appliances and security systems to fitness monitors and proximity sensors
